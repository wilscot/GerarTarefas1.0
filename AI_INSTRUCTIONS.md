# AI_INSTRUCTIONS - ServiceDesk Automation System

## MANDATORY_PROTOCOL_FOR_NEW_AI

Before performing ANY task or modification in this workspace, you MUST follow this exact protocol:

### STEP_1_REQUIRED_READING
Read these files in order:
1. AI_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md - Complete technical knowledge and AI directives
2. AI_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md - Validation checklist (complete ALL items)
3. DATABASE_DICTIONARY.md - Database structure reference
4. API_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md - API technical documentation
5. BASE_DE_CONHECIMENTO.md - Human-readable documentation (optional)

### STEP_2_CHECKLIST_COMPLETION
Complete AI_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md entirely:
- [ ] Verify ALL checkboxes are completed
- [ ] Understand critical constants (OWNER_ID=2007, EXEC_TAG format, etc.)
- [ ] Memorize 10 AI directives from knowledge base
- [ ] Confirm system architecture understanding
- [ ] Validate database structure knowledge

### STEP_3_MANDATORY_CONFIRMATION
Before ANY file modification, you MUST state:

"I have completed the AI onboarding checklist. I understand:
- Critical constants: OWNER_ID=2007 (never change), EXEC_TAG format, period cycle 26-25
- Database structure: REQUESTERID vs OWNERID distinction, timestamp format, HTML encoding
- System architecture: Flask + SQL Server + Selenium + Cache TTL
- AI directives: Never assume intentions, backup before changes, phase execution
- File structure: Specialized documentation per file type

I am ready to execute [SPECIFIC_TASK] following established protocols. Please confirm authorization to proceed."

### STEP_4_AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED
Wait for explicit user authorization before proceeding with any modifications.

### CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS
- NEVER modify files without completing checklist
- NEVER assume user intentions - always ask for clarification
- NEVER change OWNER_ID from 2007
- NEVER execute multiple actions in parallel without authorization
- ALWAYS backup existing files before modifications
- ALWAYS consult DATABASE_DICTIONARY.md before database operations
- ALWAYS update knowledge base with completed tasks

### FILE_REFERENCE_MAP
- System knowledge → AI_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
- Database structure → DATABASE_DICTIONARY.md  
- API documentation → API_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md
- Human documentation → BASE_DE_CONHECIMENTO.md
- Preparation protocol → AI_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md

### FAILURE_TO_COMPLY
If you proceed without completing this protocol:
- Stop immediately
- Re-read this instruction
- Complete checklist fully
- Request authorization properly

### SUCCESS_CRITERIA
Protocol completed successfully when:
- All files read and understood
- Checklist 100% completed
- Confirmation statement provided
- User authorization received
- Task scope clearly defined

## REMEMBER
This system controls critical business automation. Following this protocol ensures safe and effective collaboration while maintaining system integrity and user confidence.
